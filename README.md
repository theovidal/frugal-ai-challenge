# üçÉ Frugal AI Challenge

**Machine Learning challenge to build models that are not only performant, but also efficient in terms of memory and electricity consumption**

This challenge took part in January 2025 and proposed three tasks related to the environment: text classification, object detection and audio classification.

## üìµ Detecting climate disinformation

8-labels classification problem to detect disinformation in various text sources.

- Proposed model: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with GloVe embedding
- Performance: WIP
- Resources consumption: WIP

## ü™ì Detecting illegal deforestation

Binary classification problem on audio data to detect the presence of chainsaws in forests and natural environments, indicating potential illegal logging activities.

- Proposed model: 1D convolutional neural network with residual connections
- Performance: 75% accuracy
- Resources consumption: WIP
